Self organizing map and Evolutionary algorithms
==

Some Self Organizing Map and Evolutionary algorithm stuff i wrote back at university. I uploaded some video clips of the results to youtube and got a request to see the code. This is the reason I uploaded it here, the code probably useless to most people, but if you are doing some bio inspired AI stuff at school it might be worth while taking a look.


Video result of self organizing maps:

No videos of TSP+EA.

Disclaimer: This was the first time I ever wrote Scala so don't be surprised if you are experienced with Scala and thinks the code looks horrible. This code also was newer intended to be published, hence another reason for the very lacking code quality. It works, but it aint pretty.
